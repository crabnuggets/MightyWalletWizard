# Expense Tracker Application

## Background

This project is focused on developing an expense tracker application that can be accessed via both an Android mobile app and a responsive web app. The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience with software development and SDLC practices, while creating a useful personal tool for tracking expenses. As the project evolves, there are plans to integrate with external APIs, such as the DBS API, to automate data entry by pulling in personal transaction and account balance data.

Given that the initial scope is for personal use, the application does not need to be highly scalable at the outset, but the design should allow for easy addition of new features and improvements in scalability if needed in the future. All user data will be stored centrally to ensure synchronization between the mobile and web interfaces.
